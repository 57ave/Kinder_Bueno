To improve my network knowledge in C i decided to create my own server to use it on my future project


## Server

  Build the server binary with :
  ``` make ```

  Run the binary :
  ``` ./server ```

## Client

  Build the client binary with :
  ``` make ```

  Run the binary :
  ``` ./client ```
  
  Then you get a confirmation message for the connexion.
  Now you can type any message and send it with ```\n```
